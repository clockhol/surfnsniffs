    <h2>Surf and Sniffs: Philosophy</h2>
    <p class="small">At Surf and Sniffs we believe dogs deserve more than just a walk, they deserve an adventure.</p>
    <p class="small">Born by the beach and inspired by the boundless joy of salty breezes and curious noses, Surf and Sniffs is about freedom, fun, and full tail wags. We're not just leash-holders; we're your dog's surf buddy, trail guide, and sniff safari leader.</p>
    <p class="smEnd">We believe:</p>
    <ul class="pbullets">
        <li class="bullets">A good walk is a sensory experience full of sights, smells, sounds, and joy.</li>
        <li class="bullets">Nature is a playground and San Diego is our backyard.</li>
        <li class="bullets">Every dog is unique, so we tailor every outing to your pup's personality and pace.</li>
        <li class="bullets">Trust and safety come first; we walk with heart, responsibility, and real love for your best friend.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="smEnd">Whether it's a breezy beach stroll, a sunny park trot, or a mellow neighborhood cruise, Surf and Sniffs is here to keep your pup happy, healthy, and living their best California life. Because around here, every day’s a good day for a sniff and a strut by the surf.</p>

                <p><strong>Best decision we ever made for our pup!</strong></p>
                <p>Surf & Sniffs has been a total game-changer for our golden retriever, Luna. We recently moved to San Diego and were nervous about finding a walker we could trust. Not only do they take her on the coolest beach walks, but they also give us daily photo updates—Luna's smile says it all! It's clear they genuinely love dogs. Highly recommend!</p>

                <p><strong>Our dog is obsessed with them</strong></p>
                <p>We have a super high-energy husky named Diesel, and Surf & Sniffs is the only service that’s ever truly worn him out. They take him on adventure-packed walks, and he comes back happy, calm, and sandy (in the best way). Their team is always professional, on time, and super communicative. 10/10!</p>

                <p><strong>They treat our dog like family</strong></p>
                <p>Our little rescue, Bella, is shy and takes a while to warm up to new people, but the Surf & Sniffs crew was patient and gentle from day one. Now she waits by the door with her tail wagging when it's walk time. We’re so grateful to have found a team that cares for her like we do.</p>
